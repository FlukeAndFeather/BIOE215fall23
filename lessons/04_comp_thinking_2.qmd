# Let's put the *fun* in functions

No I will not apologize.

Data are nouns. Functions are verbs. Together they make sentences.

In Week 2 you learned how R organizes information in *data structures*. Then in Week 3 you used `tidyverse` functions to manipulate *data frames*. Now you're going to learn how to write your own functions.

## Functions *do* things

This is where programming gets fun. Computational thinking is all about breaking problems down into manageable pieces, solving them individually, then re-assembling them into a solution. Functions are both how you solve individual problems *and* how you reassemble them.
