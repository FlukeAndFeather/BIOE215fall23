Your instructor, Max, is a postdoc with NOAA's Southwest Fisheries Science Center. They began their career as a software engineer at Microsoft then spent ten years as a field ecologist (seabirds, mostly) and ecological data scientist (whales, mostly). His current research is on advancing open science practices in marine ecology. But more than research, their real passion is teaching (specifically, teaching data science to biologists) so they're grateful for the opportunity to teach Data Science for Eco/Evo this quarter! In his free time, he's a baker, a runner, and dog drummer (that's when you drum on the side of your dog as loud as you can).
