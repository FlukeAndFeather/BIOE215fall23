For this week you read @roche2022. You also submitted a PDF of your candidate replication paper on Canvas.

In today's discussion, you'll form final project groups of 3-4 students. Share your candidate paper with your group and explain the figure/table you'd like to replicate.

::: callout-important
Choose just *one* figure or table! It should be the key finding of the paper. You don't need to replicate the whole thing start to finish.
:::

Working together, go through each paper and make a list of data you would need to replicate the figure. Be specific! What tables of data would you need? What columns and rows would need to be in those tables?

Next week, you'll use the metrics in Table 1 of @roche2022 to assess the *completeness* and *reusability* of the data in the paper you've chosen. The data requirements you come up with today will guide that exercise.
