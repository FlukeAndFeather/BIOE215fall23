Topics will include programming best practices in R, organizing data and computational projects, and planning for reproducibility. This is a chance to gain knowledge and experience with the nuts and bolts of making your science work in code, without trying to learn generalized linear models at the same time. The course structure will be self-directed for weeks 1-6, followed by a final project in weeks 7-10."
